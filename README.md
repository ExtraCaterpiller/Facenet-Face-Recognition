# Facenet-Face-Recognition

This is a simple implementation of facenet model from this paper-'https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832'

CelebA dataset was used to train the model.
CelebA source-'https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html'

# Requirements
Tensorflow 2.10.1
opencv 4.9

Note: This is not a state of the art model So, don't expect much from it
